The project aims to create a music-generation system using Arduino and
photoresistors. It involves sensing changes in light intensity with photoresistors, converting
them to electrical signals using resistors and Arduino’s analog input, and generating
frequencies and sine waves with chuck, integrating it with an interface to monitor the input
data.
